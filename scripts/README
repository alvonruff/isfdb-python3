# There has been an unwritten rule that the scripts here are standalone, hence their previous direct
# usage of MySQLdb and localdefs.py, and reimplementation of Date_or_None() and IsfdbConvSetup().

# That's impractical if we want scripts to run under both python2 or python3, as the rest of the
# site does. As such, the Makefile in /common now copies all $(BASE_FILES) into /scripts (this directory),
# and the scripts here now connect to the database using the standard method, which is a simple 
# import of SQLparsing: 
#
# 
#        from SQLparsing import *
#
# This hides implementation differences between Python2 and Python3. Instead of instantiating the
# db variable (because there isn't such a thing under the Python3 connector), each script instantiates
# the CNX class, which implements a set of cross-connector methods:
#
#        CNX = MYSQL_CONNECTOR()
#
